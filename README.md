## Introduction
Cryptography is the practice and study of secure communication techniques, and it plays a crucial role in ensuring data security and privacy in various applications. This repository aims to provide simple yet effective implementations of fundamental cryptographic algorithms for educational and practical purposes.

## Algorithms

### Caesar Cipher
The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It operates by shifting each letter of the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.

### Morse Code
Morse Code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as sequences of two different signal durations. It is primarily used for transmitting text information in Morse code audio or visual formats.

### Playfair Cipher
The Playfair Cipher is a manual symmetric encryption technique and was the first literal digraph substitution cipher. It employs a 5x5 grid of letters constructed using a keyword and then encrypts pairs of letters in the plaintext into ciphertext.

### Vernam Cipher
The Vernam Cipher, also known as the one-time pad, is an encryption technique where each plaintext character is XORed with a corresponding random key character. It offers perfect secrecy when the key is truly random, and each key is used only once.

### Vigenère Cipher
The Vigenère Cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword to shift letters in the plaintext by different amounts. It improves upon the Caesar Cipher by using multiple alphabets and provides stronger encryption.

## Usage
Each algorithm implementation in this repository is provided as a standalone module or script. You can utilize them by importing the necessary modules or directly running the scripts with appropriate inputs. Detailed usage instructions for each algorithm can be found in their respective directories.
